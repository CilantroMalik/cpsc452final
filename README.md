#### Datasets
We used one dataset, derived from a processed scRNA count matrix from the MultiomeBrain study, which was performed as part of the PsychENCODE consortium and contributed its data to a consortium-wide pool.
Our dataset contained a subset of oligodendrocyte cells from the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) of the brains of individuals with and without schizophrenia (48 unique individuals, 24 each).
